the PLAN on the movement im thinking of using the ultra sonic sound sensor to detect
JERK acceleration and velocity and theres different responses to these physics calculations 

MY process to find these things is use the ultrta sonic sound sensor to detect  distance then give it a 1 second delay between loops to find velocity (then i differentiate the velocity then differentiate the acceleration)

the reactions i want the robot to do  are as such

velocity(reacts to  velocities above .5m/s
Acceleration(reacts to acceleration above 1m/s^2
Jerk(reacts to jerk above 1m/s^3

reactions will include changing the face 
changing the motor speed and activating the motor
